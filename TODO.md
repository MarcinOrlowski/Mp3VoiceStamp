TODO
====
 * Add support for "bell" sound each for voice announcement
 * Use ffmpeg-python instead of ffmpeg directly?
 * Add (optional) x secs padding to TITLE voice announcement
 * Added interactive mode
 * Make app less verbose by default
 * Replace "-" with "," (in title) which improves "espeak" output better (i.e. "Olga Misty - Ocean Planet" vs "Olga Misty, Ocean Plante")
 * Config save/load + config profiles support
