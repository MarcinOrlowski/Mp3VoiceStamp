## TODO ##

 * Support for "bell" sound for each voice announcement
 * Use ffmpeg-python instead of ffmpeg directly?
 * (optional) x secs padding to TITLE voice announcement
 * Interactive mode
 * Made app available via PyPi.org and installable via pip
 * Windows installer should check if PATH is not pointing to our location
